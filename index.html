                Hi! My name is Hillary Chang and I am a high school student interested in software development. I enjoy coding online programs that can positively impact the world. This tic tac toe game is a bit lighthearted and I wanted to create it to become more familiar coding in js.

                I hope you enjoy playing this game!
